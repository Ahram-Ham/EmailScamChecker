Hi Janet,

I am Jonathan and I work as a electical engineer at Intel. I saw your profile on LinkedIn and I was really impressed by your experience in industrial circuitry.
Here at Intel, we are always looking to grow our teams with talented people and achieve great things together.

We are currently looking for a engineer to join our team. I’d love to tell you a little more about this position and learn a few things about you, as well.

I’d like to talk to you so I can get to know you better and introduce our company to you.
Are you available sometime this week? If so, I’d be happy to set up a call. I’m also happy to coordinate via email or LinkedIn, if you prefer.

I hope you have a great day.

Sincerely,

Jonathan Van Zuylen
