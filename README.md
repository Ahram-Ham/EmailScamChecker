# Email Job Scam Detector

If you ever get a job email that is slightly suspicious to you, this program is able to take email text and label it either scam or non-scam. 

For inputs, create a text file with the email content and insert it into the unassigned_emails directory. From there, run the program in main.py and the program will assign a label. 

  0 - scam
  1 - non-scam

If the email length is longer than 194 words, the model will have to be retrained.
